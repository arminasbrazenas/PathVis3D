# PathVis3d
### Introduction
This application was built as an end-of-year school assessment whose purpose was to visualize the process behind pathfinding robots. 
As I primarily focused on a robotics competition called Micromouse, it was necessary to build a maze generator. 
To make it look more aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well as to challenge myself, I decided to visualize everything in 3D. 
Thanks to the Three.js library, it was not as hard as I thought it to would be.
